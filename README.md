# GovTrust
Project for GovHack 2021

**GovTrust** is a portal built on allowing users to take back control of their own data and so people can ensure they know what is happening with their data, we also want to shine an insight on what data is being collected on them and potentially (if possible) allowing the user to opt-out or anonymise the data that is being collected against them.
